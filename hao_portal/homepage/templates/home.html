            I'm Senhe Hao, a CS student at TAMU. I like doing things. Anything that catches my attention I'll do. Usually I enjoy creating or solving things but sitting down and doing nothing can be pretty interesting as well.
        </p>
		<p class="info">
			For me the best part about creation is getting to see your final product. Just the knowledge that I made something cool is enough to put me in a good mood for the rest of the week. I'll also admire and stare at my creation for long periods of time.
		</p>
		<p class="info">
			The joy in solving problems is pretty similar to creating for me. The satisfaction at the end after long periods of work and fixing issues that seem impossible to fix make everything worth it. I guess that's why I decided to do computer science; I get a chance to do a little of both.
		</p>
		<p class="info">
			I'm just a guy with a lot of questions and uncertainties. I like knowing things, so I decided that I'll do anything I can to find answers, even if they don't exist. I don't care about how difficult, or maybe even impossible, my goals will be. The search itself is plenty of fun.

            I enjoy experiencing the outdoors and going on adventures in the wilderness. During high school I was in the Scouts of America program and eventually reached Eagle. Although I got the chance to experience Northern Tier, I didn't get to trek Philmont because it burned down :(
