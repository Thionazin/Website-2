            I'm Senhe Hao, a CS student at TAMU. I like doing things. I'll do just about anything that catches my attention. Usually that's creating things or solving problems but sitting down and doing nothing can be pretty interesting as well. For me, the best part about creation is seeing the final product. Just the knowledge that I made something cool is enough to put me in a good mood for the rest of the week. It's like that with solving problems as well. The satisfaction at the end after long periods of work and fixing seemingly impossible issues make everything worth it. I guess that's why I decided to do computer science; I get a chance to do a little of both. I'm just a guy with a lot of questions and uncertainties. That's kind of a problem as I like knowing and understanding. So my lifelong goal has become an endless search for answers. I don't care how difficult my quest will be, because the search itself is plenty of fun. Right now I'm pretty heavily involved in all sorts of computer science extracurriculars and clubs. Also I'm on the lookout for work opportunities and internships.

            I enjoy experiencing the outdoors and going on adventures in the wilderness. During high school I was in the Scouts of America program and eventually reached Eagle. Although I got the chance to experience Northern Tier, I didn't get to trek Philmont because it burned down :(
